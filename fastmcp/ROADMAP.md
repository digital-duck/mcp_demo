## üéØ **RAG & AI Enhancements**

### 1. **Multi-Tool Chain Execution**
```python
# Allow queries like: "Calculate 15 + 27, then find sine of that result"
{
    "action": "chain",
    "steps": [
        {"tool": "calculator", "params": {"operation": "add", "num1": 15, "num2": 27}},
        {"tool": "trig", "params": {"operation": "sine", "num1": "${step1.result}", "unit": "degree"}}
    ]
}
```

### 2. **Conversation Memory & Context**
- Remember previous calculations in the session
- Allow references like "multiply that by 2" or "what was my last result?"
- Build conversation-aware embeddings

### 3. **Custom Tool Registration**
- Allow users to register their own tools dynamically
- Auto-generate embeddings for new tools
- Plugin architecture for easy tool addition

## üîß **Advanced Tool Features**

### 4. **Smart Parameter Inference**
```python
# Query: "What's the temperature in New York?"
# Auto-infer: {"tool": "weather", "params": {"location": "New York", "metric": "temperature"}}
```

### 5. **Tool Validation & Suggestions**
- Validate parameters before execution
- Suggest corrections for malformed queries
- Show parameter hints based on tool schemas

### 6. **Batch Operations**
```python
# "Calculate sine, cosine, and tangent of 30 degrees"
# Execute multiple related operations in parallel
```

## üìä **Analytics & Intelligence**

### 7. **Query Intent Analysis**
- Classify queries by intent (calculation, lookup, system, etc.)
- Track user patterns and suggest optimizations
- Predict next likely queries

### 8. **Performance Analytics Dashboard**
- Real-time metrics on parsing accuracy
- RAG effectiveness scoring
- Tool usage patterns and optimization suggestions

### 9. **A/B Testing Framework**
- Compare different parsing strategies
- Test RAG vs non-RAG performance
- Optimize similarity thresholds dynamically

## üåê **Integration & Extensibility**

### 10. **Multi-Modal Support**
- Image inputs for mathematical diagrams
- Voice queries with speech-to-text
- Export results to various formats (PDF, CSV, etc.)

### 11. **Real-Time Data Sources**
```python
# Tools that update their capabilities dynamically
# Weather APIs, stock prices, news feeds, etc.
# Auto-refresh embeddings when data sources change
```

### 12. **Collaborative Features**
- Share sessions between users
- Team workspaces with shared tool access
- Query templates and saved workflows

## üõ°Ô∏è **Security & Reliability**

### 13. **Tool Access Control**
- Role-based permissions for different tools
- Audit trail for sensitive operations
- Rate limiting and quota management

### 14. **Fallback & Error Recovery**
- Graceful degradation when tools are unavailable
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Alternative tool suggestions for failed operations

## üöÄ **User Experience**

### 15. **Smart Query Suggestions**
```python
# As user types, show relevant completions based on:
# - Available tools and their capabilities
# - User's query history
# - Similar queries from RAG system
```

### 16. **Interactive Result Exploration**
- Click on results to see related operations
- Visualizations for mathematical results
- Export/share functionality

### 17. **Mobile-Responsive Design**
- Touch-friendly interface
- Offline capability for cached results
- Progressive Web App (PWA) features

## üß† **Advanced RAG Features**

### 18. **Hierarchical Tool Organization**
```python
# Organize tools by category/domain
# Use hierarchical embeddings for better matching
# Support tool composition and workflows
```

### 19. **Dynamic Embedding Updates**
- Retrain embeddings based on successful queries
- Learn from user corrections and feedback
- Adaptive similarity thresholds

### 20. **Cross-Tool Knowledge Transfer**
- Use knowledge from one tool to improve others
- Share parameter patterns across similar tools
- Build tool relationship graphs

## üìà **Quick Wins to Implement First**

1. **Query History with Search** - Let users search and rerun previous queries
2. **Tool Usage Statistics** - Show which tools are most/least used
3. **Query Autocomplete** - Based on available tools and past queries
4. **Export Session** - Save entire session as markdown/JSON
5. **Tool Performance Monitoring** - Track response times and success rates

## üîÆ **Advanced Ideas**

- **Natural Language Tool Documentation**: Auto-generate user-friendly docs from tool schemas
- **Query Optimization Suggestions**: "This query could be 50% faster if you use tool X instead"
- **Predictive Tool Loading**: Pre-load tools based on user patterns
- **Integration with External Workflows**: Zapier, IFTTT, GitHub Actions
