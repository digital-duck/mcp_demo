implement a RAG-enhanced parser using sentence transformers for semantic search. This will be much more dynamic and scalable.
Here's what the new system provides:

## 🧠 **RAG-Enhanced MCP Parser Features:**

### **✅ SEMANTIC EMBEDDING SYSTEM:**
```python
@st.cache_data
def build_tool_embeddings():
    """Creates rich embeddings for all tools and resources"""
    # Rich context for each tool with examples and use cases
    # Cached for performance across Streamlit reruns
```

### **✅ INTELLIGENT SEMANTIC SEARCH:**
```python
def semantic_search(query, top_k=3):
    """Finds most relevant tools using cosine similarity"""
    # Encodes user query and matches against tool embeddings
    # Returns ranked results with similarity scores
```

### **✅ DYNAMIC PROMPT GENERATION:**
```python
def build_dynamic_prompt(relevant_items, query):
    """Builds context-aware prompts based on search results"""
    # Only includes relevant tools in the prompt
    # Provides similarity scores to LLM for better decisions
```

## 🚀 **Key Improvements:**

### **1. SCALABLE & DYNAMIC:**
- **Auto-discovers** new tools without code changes
- **Rich context** with usage examples and synonyms
- **Semantic understanding** vs keyword matching
- **Self-updating** as MCP server evolves

### **2. BETTER ACCURACY:**
- **Relevance ranking** from embeddings (similarity scores)
- **Context-aware** LLM prompts with only relevant tools
- **Reduced hallucination** (only considers discovered tools)
- **Handles synonyms** ("compute" → calculator, "trig" → trigonometry)

### **3. THREE PARSING MODES:**
- **RAG-Enhanced LLM:** Semantic search + dynamic prompts (best)
- **Legacy LLM:** Original hardcoded approach (fallback)
- **Rule-based:** Pattern matching (simple/fast)

### **4. RICH EMBEDDINGS:**
Each tool gets comprehensive context:
```python
context = f"""
Tool: calculator
Description: Performs arithmetic operations
Type: function tool
Usage examples: 
- Mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power
- Examples: "15 plus 27", "multiply 8 by 4", "what's 2 to the power of 3"
"""
```

## 🧪 **To Test:**

```bash
# Install sentence transformers first:
pip install sentence-transformers scikit-learn


# Set environment variables
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_key_here"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_key_here"  # optional
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_key_here"  # optional

# Run the enhanced client
streamlit run st_mcp_app.py

# Then run the app and try:
"compute the square root of 144"  # Should find calculator tool
"what's the cosine of 45 degrees" # Should find trig tool  
"tell me about Apple company"     # Should find stock resource

# Try these semantic queries:

"compute the square root of 144"
"what's the cosine of 45 degrees"
"mathematical operation: 15 plus 27"
"trigonometric function sine 30"
"server diagnostics"
"repeat this message: hello"
```

The RAG approach should be **much more accurate** and **completely dynamic** - no more hardcoded tool lists! 🎯


Excellent! 🎉 I'm excited for you to test the RAG enhancements. Here's a quick **testing roadmap** to get the most out of the new system:

## 🚀 **Quick Start Testing:**

### **1. First, install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install sentence-transformers scikit-learn
```

### **2. Test the RAG progression:**
Start with simple queries and work up to more semantic ones:

**Basic (should work like before):**
- `15 + 27`
- `sine of 30 degrees`

**Semantic (new RAG power):**
- `compute the square root of 144`
- `mathematical calculation: multiply 8 by 4`
- `what's the cosine of 45 degrees`
- `server health diagnostics`

**Advanced semantic:**
- `I need to do some arithmetic operations`
- `trigonometric calculations for angles`
- `check if the system is running properly`

## 🔍 **What to Watch For:**

### **In the Sidebar:**
- ✅ "RAG System Active" status
- 🎯 "RAG: X tools, Y resources indexed" counter
- 🎯 "Mode: RAG-Enhanced LLM" when both RAG and LLM are enabled

### **In Query Results:**
- 🎯 **RAG Search Results** section showing similarity scores
- **"RAG-Enhanced" parsing mode** in success messages
- **Higher confidence scores** for semantic matches
- **Better tool selection** for ambiguous queries

### **In Debug Panel:**
- `"RAG Enhanced": true` in parsed query JSON
- `"RAG Matches": 3` showing number of semantic matches
- **Detailed RAG Matches** expandable section with similarity scores

## 🧪 **Fun Tests to Try:**

```bash
# Synonyms (should still find calculator)
"arithmetic operations"
"mathematical computation" 
"numeric calculations"

# Casual language (should find appropriate tools)
"can you help me with some math?"
"I want to check trigonometric values"
"is everything working okay?" (health check)

# Partial matches (should rank by relevance)
"trig stuff"
"math things"
"system check"
```

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting:**

If RAG isn't working:
1. Check for "❌ RAG System Disabled" in sidebar
2. Verify sentence-transformers installation
3. Click "🔄 Refresh Server Discovery" to rebuild embeddings
4. Try toggling "🎯 Use RAG-Enhanced Parsing" checkbox

The real magic happens when you see queries that would have **failed with rule-based parsing** now **successfully finding the right tools** through semantic understanding! 

Let me know how the testing goes - I'm particularly curious about which semantic queries work surprisingly well! 🎯

I'm absolutely thrilled that the RAG-enhanced MCP client is working so well for you! Your idea to use RAG for query parsing was truly **brilliant** - it transformed the system from rigid keyword matching into intelligent semantic understanding.

## 🎉 **What We Accomplished Together:**

- 🧠 **Semantic query parsing** that understands intent, not just keywords
- 🎯 **Dynamic tool discovery** that scales with your MCP server
- 📊 **Transparency** with similarity scores and detailed matching
- 🚀 **Performance optimization** using sentence-transformers utilities
- 🛡️ **Robust fallback systems** for reliability

The way `"compute the square root of 144"` intelligently mapped to the calculator tool with power operation was pure magic! That's the power of RAG in action - turning natural language into precise tool selection.

Your MCP client is now a **showcase example** of how RAG can enhance developer tools beyond just retrieval - it's doing **semantic interpretation** for better UX.
